# Quiz 1: Python Basics	

**Note:** correct answers are written in **bold.**

**Q.1 Which of the following statements is correct?**

- IPython is short for Immediate Python.
- **The IPython Shell is typically used to work with Python interactively.**
- The IPython Shell is the default shell for Python.
- You have to explicitly type `print()` to print out a value when working in the IPython Shell.


**Explanation**

Use the IPython Shell for experimentation, and the script to write successive lines of code.


**Q.2 Which file extension is used for Python script files?**

-  `.script`
-  `.pyscript`

-  `.py` **correct**

-  `.python`

**Explanation**

Python scripts have the extension `.py`. `my_analysis.py` is an example of a script name.

You need to print the result of adding 3 and 4 inside a script. Which line of code should you write in the script?

- `print 3 + 4`
- `print(3 + 4)` **correct**
- `put 3 + 4` 
- `put(3 + 4)`

**Explanation**

If you do a calculation in the IPython Shell, the result is immediately printed out. If you do the same thing in the script and run it, this printout will not occur.

In Python 3, you will need `print(3 + 4)`. You need to explicitly include this `print()` function; otherwise the result will not be printed out when you run the script.
